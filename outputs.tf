/*
Leaving this blank for now; need to verify the code that I have on my side where I'm grabbing the attributes of resources deployed with azurerm_template_deployment
Values to include in output:
- public_ip
- virtual_network name
- location
- The full Azure resource ID of the remote virtual network.
- resource group

I anticipate all of those resources will need to be referenced in the VNet Peering example. Link to azurerm_virtual_network_peering: https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/r/virtual_network_peering.htm
